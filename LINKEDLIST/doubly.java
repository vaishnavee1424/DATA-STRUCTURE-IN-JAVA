//  Doubly  linked list is a list which basically similar to the singly linked list
//  but conatin the information of the previou node and it would define a 
// Head-> NODE=A -> NODE=B->NODE=C-> NODE=D->Tail.
// Node = previous pointer + Data + Next pointer.
// backward pointer of first node and forward node of last pointer is always remain empty or null.

// In between two nodes
// .After a given node.
// .Before a given node.
// At the end of the DLL.
